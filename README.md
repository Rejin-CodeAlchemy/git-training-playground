# git-training-playground

## Description
This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC) project designed to help me learn and practice Git version control. It includes basic to advanced Git operations such as committing, branching, merging, resolving conflicts, and collaborating with remote repositories.

- The essential operations in Git for setting up projects were demonstrated.
- This include :
 - initialize a repository with 'git init', 'git clone <repository URL>'
 - check file status with 'git status'
 - stage/unstage changes using 'git add' / 'git rm'
 - Branches
 - Merging
- Resolving Merge conflicts using vimdiff
- Rebase
- Git Workflow
